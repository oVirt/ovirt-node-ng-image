# oVirt Node NG Image

Welcome to the oVirt oVirt Node NG Image source repository.
This repository is hosted on [GitHub:oVirt Node NG Image](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-node-ng-image).

oVirt Node NG is a minimal operating system based on CentOS Stream (but can be based on any derivative)
that is designed to provide a simple method for setting up a physical machine to act as a hypervisor in an oVirt environment.
The minimal operating system contains only the packages required for the machine to act as a hypervisor
and features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host and performing administrative tasks.

Due to this minimalistic approach, oVirt Node NG is not recommended if you need to customize the configuration of
your virtualization hosts with multiple additional packages or third party software.

Built images of oVirt Node NG are available on [oVirt website](https://ovirt.org/download/node.html)
