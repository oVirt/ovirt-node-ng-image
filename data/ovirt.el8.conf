# Anaconda configuration file for oVirt Node Next.
#
# oVirt Node is using the image installation. The presence of a kickstart
# file with the liveimg command in it is necessary. Otherwise, Anaconda
# fallbacks to the package installation. During the image installation,
# SourceSpoke and SoftwareSelectionSpoke are hidden by default.
#

# This file overrides /etc/anaconda/product.d/ovirt.conf shipped within anaconda rpm.
